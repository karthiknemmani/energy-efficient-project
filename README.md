### All execution logic is in CacheSimulator.py

## How to run:

#### To run an individual trace:
python CacheSimulator.py [input-file]

*Note: This assumes that there is a Traces folder at the same level as the simulator file. We ensure this by including the Traces file in the zip.*

#### To run all traces:
./run.sh

*Note: Each trace only executes one time with a default L2 associativity of 4, so means will not be displayed.*

#### To generate a table of results:
python Table.py
